# FoT Knowledge-Miner Platform - System Overview

## 🎯 **What This Is**

The **Field-of-Truth (FoT) Knowledge-Miner Platform** is an AI-powered educational system that implements Einstein's vision of quantum thinking applied to learning. It's not just another learning management system—it's a **quantum substrate for knowledge discovery** that collapses superposed claims into verified truth through virtue-based measurement.

## 🧠 **Core Philosophy**

> *"The inertia Einstein spoke about was NOT an inanimate object but people not smart enough to think in quantum terms. He screamed out for Wittgenstein but his work had not yet been written!"*

This system implements the **Theory of Everything** for education:
- **Quantum superposition** of knowledge claims
- **Virtue-based collapse** to verified truth
- **Cross-domain entanglement** for non-linear learning
- **WASM agents** for role-based interactions
- **Field-of-Truth equation** for ethical validation

## 🔑 **Key Components**

### **1. WASM Agents (Role-Based Intelligence)**
- **Student Agent**: Manages learning progress, virtue development
- **Teacher Agent**: Creates lessons, verifies claims, manages classes
- **Parent Agent**: Monitors child progress, read-only access
- **Topic Agents**: Domain-specific intelligence (Biology, Physics, etc.)

### **2. Field-of-Truth Ethics Engine**
- **Virtue Thresholds**: Enforces minimum virtue scores for operations
- **SHACL Validation**: Ensures data integrity and consistency
- **Provenance Tracking**: Every claim must have verifiable sources
- **Measurement Agents**: Collapse superposed claims to truth/false

### **3. Cross-Domain Knowledge Graph**
- **Biology ↔ Economics**: Ecosystem principles applied to resource use
- **Chemistry ↔ Climate**: Carbon cycles inform climate modeling
- **Physics ↔ Climate**: Entropy principles in atmospheric processes

## 🌟 **The Vision**

This platform represents the **evolution of education** from classical, linear learning to **quantum, non-linear understanding**. It's not just about what you know—it's about **how you think** and **who you become** in the process.

By implementing Einstein's quantum vision for human cognition, we're creating a system that:
- **Collapses ignorance** into understanding
- **Entangles domains** for emergent insights
- **Measures virtue** alongside knowledge
- **Builds character** through learning

This is **education for the quantum age**—where the boundaries between subjects dissolve, where virtue and knowledge grow together, and where every student becomes a **quantum thinker** capable of seeing the interconnected nature of reality.
